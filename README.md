# Multi-Class Text Classification Trainer (TensorFlow 2)

The goal for this project is to make an easy to use multi-class text classifier;
More like an application than a data science project.
All you need to do is format your data in a CSV like so: 

```
Sentences of text,label1;label2 
```
The labels are separated by a semicolon.  You don't need multiple, but does can support multiple.

#### Setup:
1) Replace data.csv with your data.
2) Set up a virtual environment, and install the requirements
3) Run main.py

The requirement.txt file in this project assumes we want to use `tensorflow-gpu`.  
Feel free to review the requirements and adjust versions, etc.
